"""CALIBRATION task: nothing to calibrate in this demo yet.

Candidates, if the demo needs one:

* zero the power meter (``cell.power_meter(devices).zero()``) with no fiber in
  front of the fixed one, so that only the dark offset is nulled;
* re-teach ``poses.ALIGN_START`` from the position of a successful alignment.
