"""HOME task: bring the robot to its home position.

Runs on demand from the Control tab, and automatically before and after every
production run. If the robot was left at the alignment station (e.g. an
aborted alignment), it first backs out along the fiber axis.

The gripper is not touched, so a held fiber stays held. Put it back with
Manual: Place Fiber.
