"""Fiber alignment algorithm: find the light, centre on it, square the angle, climb to the peak.

Built for a demo cell that may start cold, with collimated (or lensed) fiber
ends: the coupling tolerates a lateral offset of a few hundred µm but a tilt
of a few tenths of a degree only, so first light is mostly a matter of angle.
It never moves the fiber along its axis: the gap stays the one the
``align_start`` program taught.

How wide the coupling is, against a lateral offset and against a tilt, sets
every scale here (scan spans, steps, spiral pitches). The params give starting
guesses (``lateral_width_um``, ``angle_width_deg``); each fit re-measures them.

``align`` runs four phases, each inside ``with io.phase(name):`` and plotted by
the custom view as PHASE_VIEWS declares:

1. Acquire: the noise floor where the search starts: the pose remembered for
   this fiber (``io.seed``) if there is one, else the start. Unless light
   already reaches the meter, a spiral in tilt (Rx/Rz) there, then, still
   dark, a spiral in the lateral plane, each until light shows; dark at the
   remembered pose, the same around the start. Still dark, tilt spirals at
   ``acquire_ring_um`` around the start (6 points): a picked fiber is often
   off in tilt and sideways at once, which neither spiral alone finds. Then
   the move to the best reading. With ``acquire_full_search`` (for demos), the
   first two spirals run to their full radius, whatever the start reads.
2. Center: two-way scans across the light along x then z, each fitted with a
   Gaussian over the noise floor; the fiber moves to the fitted centre until
   it no longer shifts. The two directions also measure what is left of the
   reading/pose lag.
3. Angle: for rx then rz, tilts stepping away from the current one while the
   power rises, each re-centred along the lateral axis the tilt walks the
   beam on. A parabola through the log of the power at the best tilt and its
   two neighbours gives the tilt to keep.
4. Peak: a square pattern of readings at rest around the centre (``peak_grid``
   per side, 5 by default), a quadratic fit of the log power and a Newton step
   to its top, until the steps are small; then to the best reading taken at
   rest.

Positions are offsets from the start in the start's tool frame (see
``io.local`` / ``io.pose_at``): x and z lateral (µm), y along the fiber (never
moved), rx and rz rotations about the tool axes (degrees). Scan speeds come
from the measured time between readings (``io.sample_period_s``), so readings
are as dense as intended whatever the meter and the network do.

The contract with the cell (see alignment.py): move only through ``io``, never
catch exceptions broadly, leave the fiber at the best pose found. The custom
view plots the readings and what is published here with ``io.publish()``:
"acquire", "profile" and "peak" (their fields: custom_view/__init__.py).

    a window narrower than the beam). Their centres differ by twice what
    remains of the reading/pose lag ("lag" in the profile), and their mean is
    free of it. A centre at or past the window's edge moves the window towards
    it by at most a half-span, and scans again; if no window catches the
    centre, the fiber goes to the best reading, never to an extrapolated
    centre. The width is updated from a centre caught inside a window only.
    A window without light doubles around the same middle, ``widenings``
