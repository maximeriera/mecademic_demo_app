"""The contract between the cell and the alignment algorithm.

The algorithm (algorithm.py) never touches a device. It receives an
:class:`AlignmentIO`, which moves the held fiber anywhere in 3D (position and
orientation) and reads the power meter, plus the :class:`AlignmentSettings`. It
must leave the fiber at the best position it found. Everything else is handled
here:

* Every reading is recorded with the robot's pose at the middle of the meter's
  reading (interpolated during a scan, see :meth:`AlignmentIO.scan`), and
  published to the custom view (``align_sample``) as offsets from the start in
  the start's tool frame, the frame the algorithm moves in. The graph
  therefore shows exactly what the algorithm measured, and moves only while an
  alignment runs.
* The algorithm names its phases with ``io.phase()``: they show in the top bar,
  are timed on the Production tab and are plotted by the custom view, each as
  declared in the algorithm's ``PHASE_VIEWS``. Extra data for the view (scan
  profiles, peak steps) goes through ``io.publish()``.
* Every target pose is checked **before anything is sent**: each coordinate
  must stay within ``align_range_um`` / ``align_range_deg`` of the start pose,
  and be a finite number.
* ABORT, a device fault and ``align_timeout_s`` are checked before every
  command and every reading. A scan interrupted for any reason clears the
  robot's motion queue, so queued moves never run on after it.
* The verdict is a fresh reading at the final position, compared with
  ``power_threshold_mw``. The algorithm's own claim is not used. If that
  reading falls clearly below the best reading taken at rest, the fiber goes
  back there first.

A pose is ``(x, y, z, alpha, beta, gamma)``: mm in the robot's WRF, then Euler
angles in degrees (XYZ mobile), exactly as the robot reports it. Power is in W.
