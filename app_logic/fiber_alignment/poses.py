"""Where the robot goes: programs stored on the robot, and the few poses Python still sends.

Absolute moves are robot programs, taught and edited in the Mecademic web portal
and started with ``StartProgram``. Python only knows their names (below):

``fiber<N>_in``
    From any safe pose down to slot N's grip pose. Never drives the gripper:
    Python closes it there on Pick and opens it there on Place.
``fiber<N>_out``
    From slot N's grip pose back to a safe pose. Pick and Place share both
    programs, so a fiber always goes back exactly where it was taken from.
``align_start``
    From a safe pose to the alignment start: the held fiber faces the fixed
    one with a small gap, with the TCP at the fiber tip.
``align_retract``
    From the aligned pose, anywhere inside the alignment window around the
    start, straight back out along the fiber axis to a safe pose.

Rules for the programs:

* Teach them with ``TOOL_TRF`` active. Python sets it before every step, and
  the alignment pivots about it.
* They run with the speeds Python sets (``joint_vel_pct``, ``lin_vel_mm_s``)
  unless they set their own.

Python still sends ``TOOL_TRF`` and the HOME/SHIPMENT joint positions. Until
``POSES_TAUGHT`` is True, every robot motion is refused (see
``cell.prepare_robot``).
